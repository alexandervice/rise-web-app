# RISE Web App

RISE is a tabletop roleplaying game created by Alex Vice. This project is an attempt to convert the data into an API, create a documentation website, and character creation website.

## Ideas

Currently considering rebuilding the entire app with MERN instead of Flask. Essentially using JavaScript instead of Python.

## Project Status

Project is still in it's infancy and planning stages.

Things that we still need to do:
- Finish the database (possibly use NoSQL or MongoDB instead of MySQL)
- Make the database files to import
- Create the controllers and models for each of our major database tables
- Make logic for character info
- Handle leveling up
- Update logic for complex and fringe cases
