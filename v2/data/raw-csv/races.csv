1,Human,"With their penchant for migration and conquest, humans are more physically diverse than other common races. There is no typical human. An individual can typically stand from 1.5 to 2 meters in height (5 feet to 6 and 1/2 feet) and weigh anywhere 45 to 115 kilograms (100 to 250 pounds). Human skin shades range from nearly black to very pale, and hair colors from black to blond (curly, kinky, or straight); males might sport facial hair that is sparse or thick. Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and rarely live even a single century.
Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races. They have widely varying tastes, morals, and customs in the many different lands where they have settled.  About 45% of the world's population is human.
Many other races have ties to the humans. Prior to the fall, human genetic experimentation created the Ferali, the Orions and humans share a common ancestor, and the Gargun were once enslaved by humans. The Vata warred with the humans and created the Starforged to fight them during the ancient war, and some historians believe Infernals would not exist without the ancient war",15,3,10,Punch,0.5,0,,,,choice,,1,,power,1,,,attribute,7,focus,7,focus,6,attribute,6,focus,4,focus,3,attribute,3,power,2,,,power,3,,
2,Halfling,"Halflings are a mixed race born from the bonding of a two different races (other than Starforged). Halflings vary greatly depending on the races of their parents. The great differences between their looks results in them having difficulty blending in wherever they go. The most common halflings usually have one parent that is human. Unfortunately Halflings are always infertile, so they struggle to develop lasting communities.
Halflings have no lands of their own, though they are always welcome in the most of the large cities. In large cities in regions where humans and other races interact often, halflings are sometimes numerous enough to form small communities of their own. They enjoy the company of other halflings, the only people who truly understand what it is to live between these two worlds. About 15% of the world's population is halfling.",varies,varies,varies,Punch,0.5,0,,,,6,,1,varies,,,,,attribute,choice,focus,,focus,,attribute,choice,focus,,focus,,attribute,choice,,,,,,,,
3,Orion,"The Orions used to be humans but prior to the fall their ship's stasis pods failed and they were forced to live in on their ship in space for thousands of years. The cosmic radiation caused them to mutate into the Orions prior to them reaching Elara. They have very large eyes that can see in the dark, and long dexterous fingers that they are adept at building and crafting. They are on average 1 to 1.25 m tall (3-4 ft), and weigh 35 to 75 kg (75-175 lbs). Orions have a tendancy to have paler skin and lighter colored hair, though many prefer to dye their hair. The Orions often prefer to augment their own bodies with the tech they have designed or are working on. About 10% of the world's population is Orion.
The Orions may be tech savvy but are also very superstitious and religious. They credit the Constellations with having guided them through deep space to the moon of Elara. Orions are also very likely to have ""lucky"" tools or articles of clothing, but are just as likely to throw away something that they deem ""unlucky"".
Although they have a disposition towards technology, Orions will engross themselves into the study and research of whatever catches their fancy. Some of the newest spells and experimental arcana were developed by the Orions as well. Others channel these skills to help them handle things more directly, as there is nothing worse than an angry Orion interrupted in the middle of their experiments.",18,2.5,12,Punch,0.5,0,,,,,,,,,,,,attribute,,focus,,focus,,attribute,,focus,,focus,,attribute,,,,,,,,,
4,Gargun: Fel,"Garguns are actually made up of 2 subspecies that they call Tribes, Gargun-Fel and Gargun-Ul. Most Garguns do not recognize or seem to care that they are separate species and care more about individual strength, often competing in dangerous battles and competitions simply to prove themselves. Though there are some Gargun who have chosen to leave the bloody tribal life behind and have attempted to blend into modern society within the large cities. Both tribes have short lifespans, usually less than 50 years, though some suspect this could be longer if they were less prone to seeking a glorified death in battle.
Both of the Gargun Tribes have large and physically powerful statures necessary for their home planet, a bleak place of rock, sand, wind, and ice. All Gargun stand between 1.75 to 2.5 m tall (6 to 8 feet) and weigh between 90 to 160 kilograms (200 to 340 pounds). The Gargun-Fel look as if they are carved from mountain stone, with skin colors of mostly gray and drab tones they are often covered by tribal scarring or tattoos.
Garguns were the first aliens that humanity discovered beyond their home planet. These powerful and large beings were no match for the technology and weapons the humanity wielded. And were eventually enslaved as warriors and laborers. Garguns have a short lifespan and an even shorter memory. The Gargun Tribes generally hold no grudges for the enslavement they once faced. About 10% of the world's population is Gargun.",21,3,8,Punch,0.5,0,,,,,,,,,,,,attribute,,focus,,focus,,attribute,,focus,,focus,,attribute,,,,,,,,,

Where the Gargun-Fel have more of a human semblence, the Gargun-Ul seem more monsterous. They have green/gray skin with large tusks that protrude from their lower jaw and pointed ears. Due to their looks Gargun-Ul generally recive more prejudice than Gargun-Fel.
