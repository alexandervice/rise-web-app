   "description": "With their penchant for migration and conquest, humans are more physically diverse than other common races. There is no typical human. An individual can typically stand from 1.5 to 2 meters in height (5 feet to 6 and 1/2 feet) and weigh anywhere 45 to 115 kilograms (100 to 250 pounds). Human skin shades range from nearly black to very pale, and hair colors from black to blond (curly, kinky, or straight); males might sport facial hair that is sparse or thick. Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and rarely live even a single century.\nHumans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races. They have widely varying tastes, morals, and customs in the many different lands where they have settled.  About 45% of the world's population is human.\nMany other races have ties to the humans. Prior to the fall, human genetic experimentation created the Ferali, the Orions and humans share a common ancestor, and the Gargun were once enslaved by humans. The Vata warred with the humans and created the Starforged to fight them during the ancient war, and some historians believe Infernals would not exist without the ancient war",

The great differences between their looks results in them having difficulty blending in wherever they go. The most common halflings usually have one parent that is human. Unfortunately Halflings are always infertile, so they struggle to develop lasting communities.\nHalflings have no lands of their own, though they are always welcome in the most of the large cities. In large cities in regions where humans and other races interact often, halflings are sometimes numerous enough to form small communities of their own. They enjoy the company of other halflings, the only people who truly understand what it is to live between these two worlds. About 15% of the world's population is halfling.",

   "description": "The Orions used to be humans but prior to the fall their ship's stasis pods failed and they were forced to live in on their ship in space for thousands of years. The cosmic radiation caused them to mutate into the Orions prior to them reaching Elara. They have very large eyes that can see in the dark, and long dexterous fingers that they are adept at building and crafting. They are on average 1 to 1.25 m tall (3-4 ft), and weigh 35 to 75 kg (75-175 lbs). Orions have a tendency to have paler skin and lighter colored hair, though many prefer to dye their hair. The Orions often prefer to augment their own bodies with the tech they have designed or are working on. About 10% of the world's population is Orion.\nThe Orions may be tech savvy but are also very superstitious and religious. They credit the Constellations with having guided them through deep space to the moon of Elara. Orions are also very likely to have \"lucky\" tools or articles of clothing, but are just as likely to throw away something that they deem \"unlucky\".\nAlthough they have a disposition towards technology, Orions will engross themselves into the study and research of whatever catches their fancy. Some of the newest spells and experimental arcana were developed by the Orions as well. Others channel these skills to help them handle things more directly, as there is nothing worse than an angry Orion interrupted in the middle of their experiments.",

Their eyes come in a multitude of colors and their hair is generally white or blonde.\nVata and humans are the races that brought about the Fall over a thousand years ago. The Vata who originated from a far side of the galaxy initially were friendly with humans, but the fickle and greedy humans brought the wrath of the Vata upon themselves. Nowadays most Vata live in far secluded groves and surround themselves by nature and shun technology as a means of repentance for the sins of their ancestors. \nVata can live well over 300 years, meaning only a few generations have passed for them since the fall. As such they tend to be much more patient and less prone to fighting amongst themselves than the other races.  Perhaps due to their long lifespan the Vata seldom give birth, and rarely do Vatan couples have more than two children. Though most view the Vata as cold or even unloving they are fiercely loyal and respond harshly to those who insult or attack their loved ones.",

   "description": "The Starforged are a pseudo-robotic race created with lost technology and ancient magic. In the millennia that has passed since their creation, many have had to replace their original metal parts with either stone, raw metals, and wood fibers. The core of a Starforged is an ancient crystal imbued with arcane properties. An internal network of microscopic tubes run through the Starforged's body, these tubes are filled with an alchemical blood-like fluid that is designed to transfer energy from their core and lubricate their systems.\nThe Starforged physical form can vary greatly. They stand anywhere from 1.5 to 2 meters (5 to 7 feet) tall, and can weigh anywhere from 60 to 120 kilograms (130 to 260 pounds). They have no biological sex, but many have adopted a gender role as part of their personality. They have no need to eat or sleep, but when they are injured and lose \"blood\" they must enter a form of stasis similar to sleep where they replenish their lost fluids. They gain energy from radiation given off by the sun. Starforged do not \"wear\" armor, their bodies temporarily incorporate armor into themselves, changing their shape and size to accommodate. \nOriginally built by the Vata to war against the humans, many Starforged still have a deep reverence for the Vata in their internal programming. Although the order to attack and destroy humans was wiped at the end of the ancient war. Most surviving Starforged have spent the majority of the time since the Fall in stasis due to a lack of purpose after their original programming was wiped. Those Starforged who choose to wake have often had most of their original power diminished. Less than 1% of the world's population is Starforged.",

   "description": "According to the Vatan historical account, Infernals were once Vata whose bloodlines were 'tainted' during the ancient war. Infernal bodies are generally similar in size to humans, but they have horns that take on a variety of shapes. Most infernals have tails, though some have them removed at birth so as not to stand out too much. They have pointed teeth and share the pointed ears from their Vatan ancestors. Infernal skin tones range from red to blue, and their eyes usually are one solid color.\nTheir 'demonic' appearance is, according to the Vata, the result of an ancient sin, for which they and their children and their children’s children will always be held accountable. Due to their appearance they have often been persecuted throughout the millennia since the fall. However in modern times such practices are generally illegal and looked down upon. Their numbers are small and they have a similar birth rate and life expectancy to their Vatan cousins. About 5% of the world's population is Infernal.\nIt is said that the length of an Infernal's horns are an indicator of their power, though some theorize that the horns simply continue to grow their entire lives. Whatever the case, horn length does generally correlate to the wisdom and strength of the individual. However there are those who have made a trade out of the selling of infernal horns, and they fetch quite a price on the black market. The longer they are the more expensive they sell for, although that price comes with the risk of obtaining them.",

   "description": "The Ferali people come in a huge abundance of shapes and forms called Clans. According to history the original Ferali were genetically modified humans designed to be warriors prior to the fall. Ferali have traits of both humans and beasts from humanity's original planet resulting in them displaying the largest variety of shapes and sizes of any race. Depending on Clan and animal species, Ferali can stand anywhere from 1 m to 2.5 m (4 to 8 ft) and weigh 30 to 160 kg (70 to 350 lbs). About 10% of the world's population are Ferali.\nThe Ferali often do not see themselves as one race, but instead a group of subraces that they call Clans. Within the Clan, all members are family and the bonds between Clan members are strong. Some Ferali find it difficult to regulate their emotions and instincts and tend to avoid large populations of people resulting in many city dwellers to view the Ferali as uncivilized and dangerous.\nThe Lizard Clan are wise and skillful survivors. They are a very diverse Clan with powerful healing abilities and are the most likely to choose a solitary lifestyle. The most common Clan species are Crocodile, Iguana, Gecko, Skink, and Monitor.",
